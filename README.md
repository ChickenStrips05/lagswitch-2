### A simple "exploit" that uses the firewall to block network requests.

Once you open the exe file, it will check if the process is running as Administrator, if not, it will prompt and replace the process with an admin one.

⚠️**Administrator permissions are required** since this app modifies your firewall in real time.

To toggle the exploit, you press the backtick key (`). Note that this will block other apps from recieving the key input.
You will also see a popup showing "Blocked" or "Unblocked" - your current firewall state.

This may be used in many apps, I have not tested many.
